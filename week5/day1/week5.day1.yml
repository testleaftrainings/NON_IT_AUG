TestNG
============

Test-Next Generation(TestNG)

J-Unit ---java
N-unit ---.Next

TestNG-Execution Framework

Limitation:

1.one by one(1000 UI automated testcase)
 -time consuming 
 -manually someone have to present

 *Sequential and Parallel Execution(run more than one testcase at same time)

2.Run for hardCoded data

* Run with different set of data without hardcode value

3.There is no reporting data

* can able get basic status or report for testcase

4.There is no way to filter the testcase to run

* groups-filter

5.There is no way to re-run the failure testcase

*automated re-run


Selenium:
CreateLead,
Edit lead,
CreateAcct,
delete Lead.


TestNG: Mall
CreateLead,
Edit lead,
CreateAcct,
delete Lead.

seq and parallel



thread-count--> handle number of browser in your system

default value thread -count =2
max=10

thread-count=5


2-browser

      <class name="week5.day1.CreateLead"/>
      <class name="week5.day1.DeleteLead"/>
      <class name="week5.day1.EditLead"/>
      
    </classes>

Annotation:


* @Test - Mandatory
* Other annotation are optional

BeforeSuite- Start report(execute only once)
    beforeTest -connect db,excel sheet
      beforeClass - common  action (Tc name,desc)
       beforeMethod-Precondition
          @Test- Create
       AfterMethod-PostCondition

       beforeMethod-Precondition
          @Test- Edit
       AfterMethod-postCondition
       
     after class-stop
   after test -stop
after suite   -stop report      



preCondition- browser,load url,username and password,login

postCondition- close
